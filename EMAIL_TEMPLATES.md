# Email System Documentation

## Overview

SaveDriveNow now features a beautiful, professional email system that sends HTML emails when leads fill out the form. The system includes two types of emails:

1. **Lead Notification Emails** - Sent to subscribers when a new lead is created
2. **Welcome Emails** - Sent to leads to thank them for their submission (optional)

- Fallback plain text versions for compatibility
- Rich formatting with icons, cards, and structured layouts

### Lead Notification Email Features
- Complete lead information display
- Contact buttons (email and phone)
- Vehicle information (if provided)
- Professional styling with SaveDriveNow branding
- Organized information sections

### Welcome Email Features
- Thank you message for the lead
- Clear next steps explanation
- Information summary
- Professional appearance
- Call-to-action for additional quotes

## Configuration

### Email Settings
The email system uses the existing Django email configuration in `settings.py`:

```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.zoho.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_USER', 'leads@savedrivenow.com')
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD', '')
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = os.environ.get('DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL', 'leads@savedrivenow.com')
```

### Enable/Disable Welcome Emails
Welcome emails are currently disabled by default. To enable them, uncomment the lines in `leads/models.py`:

```python
# Optionally send welcome email to the lead
# Uncomment the lines below if you want to send welcome emails
# from .email_utils import send_welcome_email
# send_welcome_email(self)
```

## File Structure

```
leads/
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ emails/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ new_lead_notification.html  # HTML template for lead notifications
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ new_lead_notification.txt   # Text template for lead notifications
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ welcome_email.html          # HTML template for welcome emails
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ welcome_email.txt           # Text template for welcome emails
â”œâ”€â”€ email_utils.py                      # Email utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ management/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ commands/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ test_email_templates.py     # Command to test email templates
â””â”€â”€ models.py                           # Updated with new email logic
```

## Testing

### Test Email Templates
Use the management command to test email templates with sample data:

```bash
# Test both notification and welcome emails
python manage.py test_email_templates --test-email your-email@example.com

# Test only notification email
python manage.py test_email_templates --test-email your-email@example.com --send-notification

# Test only welcome email
python manage.py test_email_templates --test-email your-email@example.com --send-welcome
```

### Preview in Admin
1. Go to Django Admin â†’ Leads
2. Click on any lead
3. Click the "ðŸ“§ Preview Email" link to see how the email will look
4. Add `?type=welcome` to the URL to preview the welcome email

## How It Works

### Lead Notification Flow
1. User fills out the form on the website
2. New `Lead` object is saved to the database
3. `Lead.save()` method triggers `LeadsSubscriber.email_leads_to_active_subscribers()`
4. System finds all active subscribers (`is_active=True`)
5. Beautiful HTML email is sent to each subscriber
6. Subscriber's `number_of_leads_sent` counter is incremented

### Welcome Email Flow (Optional)
1. After the lead notification emails are sent
2. If enabled, `send_welcome_email()` is called
3. Welcome email is sent to the lead's email address
4. Lead receives a thank you email with next steps

## Email Templates

### Notification Email Sections
- Header with SaveDriveNow branding
- Lead's personal information
- Contact information with clickable email/phone links
- Address details
- Driving history
- Vehicle information (if provided)
- Action buttons for easy contact
- Professional footer

### Welcome Email Sections
- Thank you header
- Personal greeting
- Next steps explanation (3-step process)
- Information summary
- Call-to-action section
- Professional footer with contact info

## Customization

### Styling
All styles are contained within the HTML templates. You can modify:
- Colors in the CSS variables
- Layout and spacing
- Fonts and typography
- Button styles
- Brand colors

### Content
- Update template text directly in the HTML/text files
- Modify email subject lines in `email_utils.py`
- Add new template variables as needed

### Adding New Email Types
1. Create new HTML and text templates in `leads/templates/emails/`
2. Add new function in `email_utils.py`
3. Call the function from appropriate model methods or views

## Error Handling

The email system includes comprehensive error handling:
- Failed emails are logged with details
- Subscriber counters are only incremented on successful sends
- Graceful fallback to plain text if HTML fails
- Non-blocking operation (won't prevent lead creation if email fails)

## Production Considerations

1. **Email Delivery**: Ensure SMTP credentials are properly configured
2. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing email rate limiting for high-volume usage
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor email delivery success rates
4. **Spam Prevention**: Ensure proper SPF/DKIM records for your domain
5. **Unsubscribe**: Consider adding unsubscribe functionality for compliance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Emails not sending**: Check SMTP configuration and credentials
2. **HTML not rendering**: Verify template paths and syntax
3. **Images not showing**: Use absolute URLs for any images
4. **Mobile formatting**: Test on various email clients

### Debug Mode
In development, you can use the console email backend for testing:
```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'
```

This will print emails to the console instead of sending them.
